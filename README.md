Optical-Inspection-of-PCBs

This project is intended to execute optical inspection of PCBs for bare, assembled boards and solder joints based on template and defective board comparison.
By editing relevant parts and changing required parameters you can inspect your defective board based on template board image in JPEG format or there are some board image pairs available to test in BOARD LIBRARY  file.
Please refer to the research paper for more information.
